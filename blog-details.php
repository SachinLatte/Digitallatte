            <p class="primary-color"><strong>7 Years of Brewing!</strong></p>
            <p>I feel a sense of pride and joy to look back at these 7 significant and remarkable years. It's surely been a busy seven years!
                 When I look at our team today, it's hard to believe that in December 2011, it was just Dipti and me.
                 We've undergone so many changes and everyone has worked so hard, so it feels nice to take a moment to reflect.
            </p>
            <p>Digital Latte has come through a lot of ups and downs in all these years, and we are proud to have emerged as one
                of the leading Digital & Social Media Marketing Agencies in Mumbai & India.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
            <p>
                Working at Digital Latte has always been a challenging, stimulating, exciting, and a continuous learning experience. The reputation that we have
                earned as a service provider is a collective outcome of each member of the team who has diligently worked to brew beyond the ordinary and had
                the courage to execute those ideas.  For this, my sincere thanks goes to the wonderful and amazing team.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Our Clients</strong></p>
            <p>
                We have been blessed with a great client base who have placed their trust in us, given us the creative liberties to explore innovative ideas and backed
                us to execute them. We have learnt a lot from all our clients over the years, and we thank them for giving us truly enriching and fulfilling project experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is extremely humbling to see that our foremost clients are also still in touch with us and never hesitate to reach out for new projects and assignments.
                It reassures us that we are doing something right and works as a proof of the good work done by us. Our sincere gratitude goes out to all our clients, old and new.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Road Ahead....</strong></p>
            <p>
                While it is fun to look back, it is equally exciting to look forward. I believe in seeing many more great experiences, more growth and excitement ahead.
                The next milestone that we want to scale, is wowing our clients with amazing and unexpected experiences. So far, we have been successful in creating
                a happy ecosystem for our clients, and I completely trust our team to elevate this wonderful experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also promise ourselves to expand our creative boundaries and retain the same passion in our hearts and the fire in our bellies as on day one.
